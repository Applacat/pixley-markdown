# AI.md Reader - Pre-Ship Security & Quality Review
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Reviewer:** AI Code Assistant  
**Status:** ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND - DO NOT SHIP WITHOUT FIXES

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment: 6.5/10** - Good architecture, but critical security and performance issues must be addressed.

This codebase shows strong object-oriented design patterns and good use of modern Swift features. However, there are **3 critical security issues** and **several performance concerns** that would be reputationally harmful if shipped to production.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Shipping)

### 1. **DoS Vulnerability: No File Size Limits** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**File:** `MarkdownView.swift:128-136`

**Issue:** Loading files with no size validation could crash the app or hang the system.

```swift
// CURRENT CODE - VULNERABLE
let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
guard let text = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else {
    throw NSError(...)
}
```

**Attack Vector:** 
- Malicious user opens a 5GB markdown file
- App attempts to load entire file into memory
- System hangs or app crashes
- User loses work and blames the app

**Fix Required:**
```swift
// Check file size first
let attributes = try FileManager.default.attributesOfItem(atPath: fileURL.path)
let fileSize = attributes[.size] as? Int ?? 0

guard fileSize <= 10_485_760 else { // 10MB limit
    throw FileLoadError.fileTooLarge(size: fileSize)
}

let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** in MarkdownEditor.swift (added maxTextSize constant)  
**Remaining:** Need to add check in MarkdownView.swift before loading

---

### 2. **Regex DoS: Unbounded Pattern Matching** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**File:** `MarkdownHighlighter.swift:95-106`

**Issue:** Running regex patterns on extremely large text without limits can cause catastrophic backtracking.

```swift
// CURRENT CODE
let matches = regex.matches(in: text, range: fullRange)
```

**Attack Vector:**
- 10MB file with deeply nested markdown patterns
- Regex catastrophic backtracking causes CPU spike
- App becomes unresponsive
- User force-quits and leaves bad review

**Fix Required:**
```swift
// Add timeout and size limits to highlighting
func highlight(_ text: String) -> NSAttributedString {
    // Don't highlight files over 1MB (syntax highlighting is for reading, not massive logs)
    guard text.utf8.count <= 1_048_576 else {
        return NSAttributedString(string: text, attributes: [
            .font: baseFont,
            .foregroundColor: NSColor.labelColor
        ])
    }
    
    // ... rest of highlighting
}
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT FIXED**

---

### 3. **Temporary File Cleanup Failure** ⚠️ MODERATE
**File:** `AIMDReaderApp.swift:272-277`

**Issue:** Welcome folder copied to temp is only cleaned up in `closeFolder()`, but not if app crashes.

```swift
// CURRENT CODE
if let tempDir = welcomeTempDirectory {
    try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempDir)
    welcomeTempDirectory = nil
}
```

**Impact:**
- Each app launch creates a new temp directory
- Directories never cleaned up if app crashes
- After 100 launches, user has 1GB+ of temp junk
- User blames app for "taking up space"

**Fix Required:**
```swift
// On app launch, clean up old temp directories
private func cleanupOldWelcomeFolders() {
    let tempDir = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
    let prefix = "AImdReaderWelcome-"
    
    if let enumerator = FileManager.default.enumerator(atPath: tempDir.path) {
        for case let item as String in enumerator where item.hasPrefix(prefix) {
            let itemURL = tempDir.appendingPathComponent(item)
            try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: itemURL)
        }
    }
}
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT FIXED**

---

## 🟡 PERFORMANCE ISSUES (Should Fix Before Shipping)

### 4. **Inefficient Folder Scanning**
**File:** `FolderService.swift:135-171`

**Issue:** Full recursive scan on every folder load, even when nothing changed.

**Current Behavior:**
- User opens folder with 10,000 files
- App scans entire tree on launch (2-3 seconds)
- User switches to different folder
- Returns to first folder
- **Cache invalidated, scans again** (another 2-3 seconds)

**Code:**
```swift
FolderService.shared.invalidateCache(for: rootURL)
rootItems = await FolderService.shared.loadTree(at: rootURL)
```

**Apple Would Ship:** No. Apple uses FSEvents to monitor file changes and only rescans modified directories.

**Recommendation:** 
- Keep cache between sessions
- Only invalidate on actual file system changes
- Use `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource()` to watch for changes

---

### 5. **Unbounded Debounce Task Queue**
**File:** `MarkdownHighlighter.swift:181-194`

**Issue:** Rapid typing creates many cancelled Tasks that still consume memory until GC.

```swift
debounceTask?.cancel()

debounceTask = Task { @MainActor in
    try? await Task.sleep(for: delay)
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:** 
- User types 1000 characters quickly
- 1000 Tasks created and cancelled
- Memory usage spikes
- **SwiftUI warning:** "Publishing changes from background threads"

**Fix:** Use AsyncStream or Combine debounce instead of raw Tasks.

---

### 6. **Selection Preservation Bug**
**File:** `MarkdownEditor.swift:77-88` (NOW FIXED)

**Issue:** Preserving selection ranges before re-highlighting can cause crashes if text shrinks.

```swift
let selectedRanges = textView.selectedRanges
// ... modify text storage ...
textView.selectedRanges = selectedRanges  // CRASH if ranges now out of bounds
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially mitigated by debouncing, but still vulnerable

---

## 🟢 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (Already Good)

✅ **Security-scoped bookmarks** for folder access (AIMDReaderApp.swift)  
✅ **Proper isolation** with `@MainActor` and `nonisolated`  
✅ **Weak references** in Task closures (MarkdownEditor.swift)  
✅ **No hardcoded credentials** or API keys  
✅ **Sandboxed app** (uses security-scoped resources correctly)

---

## 🎨 CODE QUALITY REVIEW

### Question 1: "Is this beautiful code?"

**Rating: 7/10** - Good architecture, minor rough edges

**✅ Beautiful:**
- Excellent OOD patterns (FolderItem tree structure is elegant)
- Clean separation of concerns (FolderService, HighlightService, etc.)
- Modern Swift concurrency used correctly
- Clear comments and documentation

**⚠️ Could Be Better:**
- ~~Unused `DebouncedHighlighter` class~~ ✅ NOW FIXED
- Some force-unwrapping (OutlineFileList.swift:185 `folderItem.children!`)
- Magic numbers scattered throughout (should be named constants)
- Inconsistent error handling (some silent failures, some logged)

**Example of Beautiful Code:**
```swift
// FolderService.swift - Elegant recursive tree building
let children = Self.loadTreeSync(at: itemURL)
let mdCount = children.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.markdownCount }
let item = FolderItem(url: itemURL, isFolder: true, markdownCount: mdCount, children: children)
```

---

### Question 2: "Would Apple ship this?"

**Rating: 6/10** - Close, but not without fixes

**Apple Would Require:**

❌ **Performance profiling** - No evidence of Instruments usage  
❌ **File size limits** - All Apple text editors have implicit limits  
❌ **Accessibility audit** - No VoiceOver support for syntax highlighting  
❌ **Localization** - All strings are hardcoded English  
❌ **Help documentation** - No in-app help or tooltips  
⚠️ **User preferences** - Currently disables spell-check (now fixed!)

**Apple Would Love:**
✅ Native AppKit integration (NSOutlineView)  
✅ Security-scoped bookmarks for privacy  
✅ Clean, minimal UI design  
✅ SwiftUI + AppKit hybrid approach  

**Missing Apple Polish:**
- No drag-and-drop reordering in file list
- No keyboard shortcuts shown in menus
- No preferences window
- Welcome folder tutorial is hidden (good easter egg, but should be more discoverable)

---

### Question 3: "Are there any security or other critical bugs?"

**YES - 3 Critical, 2 Moderate**

**Critical:**
1. ⚠️ DoS via large file loading (no size limits)
2. ⚠️ Regex catastrophic backtracking (no complexity limits)
3. ⚠️ Temp file accumulation (no cleanup on crash)

**Moderate:**
4. ⚠️ Race condition in textDidChange (multiple Tasks can fire)
5. ⚠️ NSOutlineView force-unwrap can crash on malformed cache

**Low Priority:**
6. ⚠️ Silent failure when Welcome folder missing (should show alert)
7. ⚠️ No validation of bookmark data integrity

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Block Ship):
1. **Add file size validation** in MarkdownView.swift (30 min)
2. **Add highlighting size limit** in MarkdownHighlighter.swift (15 min)
3. **Add temp cleanup** in AIMDReaderApp.swift (20 min)
4. **Fix force-unwrap** in OutlineFileList.swift (10 min)

**Total Time: ~90 minutes to unblock ship**

### Short Term (Before 1.0):
5. Add accessibility labels (2 hours)
6. Add localization infrastructure (4 hours)
7. Profile with Instruments and fix leaks (2 hours)
8. Add comprehensive error handling (3 hours)

### Long Term (Future Versions):
9. Add file system monitoring (8 hours)
10. Add search functionality (6 hours)
11. Add export/print (4 hours)
12. Add preferences window (6 hours)

## 🏆 FINAL VERDICT

### Can We Ship This?

**NO - Not without Priority 1 fixes**

The architecture is solid and the code is generally well-written, but the security issues are too significant to ignore. A malicious or corrupted file could:
- Crash the app
- Hang the user's system
- Fill up disk space with temp files

These are all **reputationally harmful** issues that would generate bad App Store reviews.

### After Priority 1 Fixes:

**YES - With caveats**

This would be a solid 1.0 release with known limitations:
- English-only
- Limited accessibility
- No advanced features (search, etc.)

But it would be **stable, secure, and performant** for the core use case.
