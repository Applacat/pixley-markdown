### Markdown Highlighting

This app's syntax highlighting is powered by **custom NSRegularExpression patterns** designed specifically for markdown. The highlighting engine includes:

- Heading detection (# ## ###)
- Code block and inline code highlighting
- Bold and italic text styling
- Link and list styling
- Blockquote and separator detection

**Implementation:**
- Pattern-based regex matching
- Compiled patterns for performance
- Debounced rendering for smooth typing
- NSAttributedString styling

All markdown highlighting code was written in-house using Swift and AppKit's NSTextView.

### Technologies Used

- **Swift** — Apple's modern programming language
- **SwiftUI** — Declarative UI framework
- **AppKit** — NSTextView for text rendering
- **Swift Concurrency** — Actor-based isolation for thread safety
- **Foundation Models** (optional) — On-device AI for chat features

### Design Philosophy

AI.md Reader follows these principles:

1. **Native First** — Built with Apple's frameworks for the best macOS experience
2. **Performance Matters** — Debounced highlighting, size limits, efficient caching
3. **Security by Design** — File size limits (10MB), regex DoS prevention, sandboxed
4. **Object-Oriented Design** — Clean separation of concerns, testable components
